CS 546 GAN Genre Combination Project

This repository is the repository for a group class project in CS584, Advanced Topics in Machine Learining.
Group members included Logan Blakely, Leila Hawana, Erik Schmauss, Eric Tsai, and Li-Yun Wang.  

This code is the lightly modified version of the code originally from https://github.com/olofmogren/c-rnn-gan and described in this paper:	
C-RNN-GAN: Continuous recurrent neural networks with adversarial training by Olof Mogren (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09904)

Project Summary:
Use the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) code above to generate two different genres of music and experiment with combining genres.
